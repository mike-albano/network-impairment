The purpose of this is to emulate a simple client <==> server model with a router inbetween. Different network impairments will be applied to show examples of various network failure scenarios.

While this is simply a Linux container routing between two other containers ()"client" and "server") the concepts apply to Access Points as well; or any network element responsible for carrying traffic between two hosts.
The main impairments we'll be analyzing are:
* Deley
* Packet Loss
* QoS Buffer overflow

# Requirements
* docker

# Quickstart
* git clone this repo
* docker-compose up
* [in 3 terminals] docker attach client|server|router

# Scenario 1 [ICMP Network Delay]
This example will apply delay at the routers outgoing interface towards the server.
In the real world this could happen for any number of reasons, including link capacity, AP/Router CPU, software-but etc.

On the router container lets introduce 250ms of delay on the interface headed towards the Server:
```
tc qdisc add dev eth2 root netem delay 250ms
```
## Verify it's broken
Ping the Server **from the Client**
```
root@33a60d9be0a7:/home/simpleclient# ping 172.18.1.5
PING 172.18.1.5 (172.18.1.5) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 172.18.1.5: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 **time=252 ms**
64 bytes from 172.18.1.5: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 **time=251 ms**
64 bytes from 172.18.1.5: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 **time=251 ms**
64 bytes from 172.18.1.5: icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 **time=250 ms**
```
## Analyze the PCAP
When looking at packet captures, choosing the location (or device) is critical. Here we'll run TCPDUMP on the Routers interfaces to isolate where they delay is occuring.

First, on the interface headed towards the client:
```
root@d9fbc3167c1e:/home/router# tcpdump -n -i eth0
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
15:40:23.161935 IP 172.18.0.5 > 172.18.1.5: ICMP echo request, id 22, seq 1, length 64
15:40:23.412485 IP 172.18.1.5 > 172.18.0.5: ICMP echo reply, id 22, seq 1, length 64
```
You can subtract the timestamps to see the same amount of latency being reported by the ping command. Eg; 23.412485 - 23.161935 = 0.25055 (~250ms). Alternatively, you can also print the timestamps as a delta from previously captured packet (no need for the math). For example
```
root@d9fbc3167c1e:/home/router# tcpdump -n -i eth0 -ttt
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
 00:00:00.000000 IP 172.18.0.5 > 172.18.1.5: ICMP echo request, id 29, seq 1, length 64
 **00:00:00.250685** IP 172.18.1.5 > 172.18.0.5: ICMP echo reply, id 29, seq 1, length 64
 00:00:00.750663 IP 172.18.0.5 > 172.18.1.5: ICMP echo request, id 29, seq 2, length 64
 **00:00:00.250717** IP 172.18.1.5 > 172.18.0.5: ICMP echo reply, id 29, seq 2, length 64
 00:00:00.750206 IP 172.18.0.5 > 172.18.1.5: ICMP echo request, id 29, seq 3, length 64
 **00:00:00.250473** IP 172.18.1.5 > 172.18.0.5: ICMP echo reply, id 29, seq 3, length 64
 ```

That just shows us what we already knew; so lets try to isolate it further. Since the delay is apparent on the interface heading towards the client, lets look at the next step upstream, the interface headed towards the server
```
root@d9fbc3167c1e:/home/router# tcpdump -n -i eth2 -ttt
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth2, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
 00:00:00.000000 IP 172.18.0.5 > 172.18.1.5: ICMP echo request, id 30, seq 1, length 64
 **00:00:00.000247** IP 172.18.1.5 > 172.18.0.5: ICMP echo reply, id 30, seq 1, length 64
 00:00:01.003734 IP 172.18.0.5 > 172.18.1.5: ICMP echo request, id 30, seq 2, length 64
 **00:00:00.000207** IP 172.18.1.5 > 172.18.0.5: ICMP echo reply, id 30, seq 2, length 64
 00:00:00.999918 IP 172.18.0.5 > 172.18.1.5: ICMP echo request, id 30, seq 3, length 64
 **00:00:00.000394** IP 172.18.1.5 > 172.18.0.5: ICMP echo reply, id 30, seq 3, length 64
```
Looking at the timestamps, the delay is NOT apparent here. This points at the delay occurring somewhere between the incoming interface FROM the Client and the outgoing interface TO the Server; eg the Router.

But what if we didn't know which direction the delay was being incurred on? Since Ping reports the RTT, let's single out whether the delay is occurring in the upstream or downstream. Perhaps you don't have access to the router, or intermediate network element, but you do have access to the Client and Server. Or maybe you have access to the Client, Server and first-hop router (or Access Point), but do not have access to the next upstream router. For this example, we'll capture on both the Client and Server and take a closer look at the two pcaps to identify where the direction of the incurred delay.
```
$docker ps -f name=client
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                   CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
**33a60d9be0a7**        mike909/client:v1   "/bin/sh -c '\"/home/â€¦"   3 hours ago         Up 3 hours                              client
$docker exec -it 33a60d9be0a7 bash
root@33a60d9be0a7:/home/simpleclient# tcpdump -n -i eth0 -w /mnt/hostdir/client_pings_delayed.pcap
# And on the Server:
root@3c2c5b896825:/home/server# tcpdump -n -i eth0 -w /mnt/hostdir/server_pings_delayed.pcap
tcpdump: listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes

root@33a60d9be0a7:/home/simpleclient# ping 172.18.1.5 -c3
```
Now, in our hosts directory we have the two pcaps; one from Client and other from Server. In this contrived example we can simply open them both in Wireshark and analyze separately; however in a more complex situation, it may be beneficial to combone both pcaps into a single file, and analyze together. Open one pcap, then File-->Merge and select the other.
Note, Wireshark won't be able to 'follow' the ICMP Echo/Reply conversation from the Client, however you can use the Sequence numbers yourself to follow it. For example:
![icmpfollow](img/combined1.png)
and the corrosponding reply in packet 4...
![icmpfollow](img/combined2.png)

Note, I've changed the preferences to show Source and Dest as MAC instead of IP here to make it easier to read (Preferences-->Columns). I've also modified the address resolution to rename the MACs to Client, Server and Router instead of the actual MAC address. Do this in View-->Name Resolution-->Edit Resolved Name; or populate a file named 'ethers' in your config directory (see Help-->About Wireshark-->Folders). For example, my ethers file:
```
02:42:ac:12:00:05 Client
02:42:ac:12:00:01 Router_eth0
02:42:ac:12:01:01 Router_eth2
02:42:ac:12:01:05 Server
```
Now we can deduce that the 250ms delay in RTT (pings) is occurring in the upstream direction since the time delta between the Echo Reply FROM the Server and receiving it at the Client is minimal as compared to the Echo Reequest FROM the Client being recieved by the Server. For example:
From Client TO Server:
![upstream_ping](img/upstream_ping.png)
From Server TO Client:
![downstream_ping](img/downstream_ping.png)
We can also deteremine that it's not the Server introducing processing delay, by looking at the delta between the Server recieving the Echo Request and sending the Echo Reply. This would be visible in tcpdump as well:
```
root@3c2c5b896825:/home/server# tcpdump -n -i eth0 -ttt
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
 00:00:00.000000 IP 172.18.0.5 > 172.18.1.5: ICMP echo request, id 16, seq 3418, length 64
 00:00:00.000079 IP 172.18.1.5 > 172.18.0.5: ICMP echo reply, id 16, seq 3418, length 64
 ```
Also worth pointint out othere tools which can help find the problem without capturing packets, for example traceroute and mtr.
```
root@74ea77a5ea2d:/home/simpleclient# mtr 172.18.1.5 -n -c 5 -r
Start: 2019-04-18T21:44:19+0000
HOST: 74ea77a5ea2d                Loss%   Snt   Last   Avg  Best  Wrst StDev
  1.|-- 172.18.0.1                 0.0%     5    0.2   0.2   0.2   0.2   0.0
  2.|-- 172.18.1.5                 0.0%     5  251.7 252.4 250.8 254.4   1.4
```
You can clearly see the latency being introduced at some point after the first hop. Likewise, a traceroute shows similar results:
```
root@6e3f5560202e:/home/simpleclient# traceroute 172.18.1.5 -n
traceroute to 172.18.1.5 (172.18.1.5), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  172.18.0.1  1.365 ms  1.211 ms  1.160 ms
 2  172.18.1.5  251.492 ms  251.416 ms  251.376 ms
 ```
Note, this is with the delay being introduced on the eth2 interface.
## Downstream Network Delay
We can mimic the same thing in the downstream direction by changing our tc command, for example:
```
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 250ms
```
Note, you'll actually see 500ms of delay here, since it's cumulative (we are still delaying packets egressing eth2). You can remove the delay with the following:
```
tc qdisc del dev eth2 root netem
```

## Finding the root

If this router was an AP, the Delay could be due to contention/congestion, or excessive 802.11 retries; in either direction.. Clearly here we're doing the pcap on the Client interface, so no 802.11 (where you'd see something like excessive 802.11 retries quite clearly). For that you'd need an over-the-air packet capture. More on that later.

# Scenario 2 [TCP Network Delay]
Lets analyze an HTTP download from a few different POV's. First, start a simple webserver **on the Server container:**
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```
**On the router**, let's bring back our delay; set to 200ms
```
tc qdisc add dev eth2 root netem rate 1gbit delay 200ms
```
## Looking only at the Client pcap
This assumes we **ONLY** have access to the client-side wired pcap.
Start the pcap **on the Client**
```
docker exec -it client bash
tcpdump -n -i eth0 -w /mnt/hostdir/pcaps/client_curl_delayed.pcap
```
Use Curl to download a 100MB file from the server:
```
curl -o /dev/null 172.18.1.5/dummyfile
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  100M  100  100M    0     0  11.1M      0  0:00:08  0:00:08 --:--:-- 14.5M
```
First, we can see the latency between Client and Server, by looking at the delta between the SYN and the SYN-ACK.
This should align closely with the ping results:
![syn_ack_delta](img/syn-ack-delta.png)
Second, we can see the Throughput in a number of ways:
a) Usinig I/O graph (nice for seeing throughput over time). In our case we are getting 92Mb/s at the 3 second mark.
![curl_100MB](img/curl_delayed.png)
b) look at the "average" Mb/s by either going to Statistics-->capture file properties OR Statistics-->Protocol Heirarchy:
![curl_100MB2](img/proto-breakdown-delayed.png)
Note the difference here due to this being average, not a 'point in time' as in the IO Graph.

This aligns with the curl output above (Average Dloud=11.1MB/s). We can also see this with iperf3 reesults, betweeen Client and Server:
```

```
With only one viewpoint (Clients) this doesn't help us identify 'where' the slowdown is occurring. For that, similar to above, we need to capture on the other side as well. Just like above, our analysis depends on which element we're capturing on.
Capturing on the Router, we compare the incoming SYN on eth0 to the outgoing SYN on eth2. This can be easily done in Wireshark (as seen above) but for the purposes of this example, I'll do a tcpdump on all Router interfaces.
```
root@6f0df20286b0:/home/router# tcpdump -i any -n -ttt
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on any, link-type LINUX_SLL (Linux cooked), capture size 262144 bytes

 00:00:00.000290 IP 172.18.1.5.80 > 172.18.0.5.60374: Flags [S.], seq 2839013440, ack 3056652435, win 28960, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 1562284 ecr 1562264,nop,wscale 7], length 0
 00:00:00.000022 IP 172.18.1.5.80 > 172.18.0.5.60374: Flags [S.], seq 2839013440, ack 3056652435, win 28960, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 1562284 ecr 1562264,nop,wscale 7], length 0
```
You can see the 200ms latency on line 2. Line 1 is the reception of the SYN on eth0 and line 2 is the egress of the SYN on eth2.
Going the other way, line 3 you see the SYN-ACK being recieved on eth2 and egressing eth0 on line 4 .00022ms later.
Note, you probably won't have the luxury of capturing on all interfaces on a network element; so you would need to combine the pcaps as done in the example above.

## Determining whether it's Server induced latency.
Here again we can simply compare Line 1 (Clients SYN) to the Line 2 (Servers SYN-ACK). You can see the Server responds within .084ms. However the delta between the Servers SYN-ACK (line 2) and the Clients ACK (line 3) shows 200ms of latency.
```
root@682de95eed2a:/home/server# tcpdump -n -i eth0 -ttt
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes

 00:00:00.000084 IP 172.18.1.5.80 > 172.18.0.5.60388: Flags [S.], seq 2714386468, ack 3172441469, win 28960, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 1692849 ecr 1692829,nop,wscale 7], length 0
 00:00:00.200604 IP 172.18.0.5.60388 > 172.18.1.5.80: Flags [.], ack 1, win 229, options [nop,nop,TS val 1692849 ecr 1692849], length 0
 00:00:00.000129 IP 172.18.0.5.60388 > 172.18.1.5.80: Flags [P.], seq 1:84, ack 1, win 229, options [nop,nop,TS val 1692849 ecr 1692849], length 83: HTTP: GET /dummyfile HTTP/1.1
```
Now this is again oversimplifying; since it's entirely possible that the connection establishment (SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK) is fast; but the Server is then slow to respond later on in the connection. You can use the TCP Stream Graph (Statistics --> TCP Stream Graphs) to visualize the full conversation, as it relates to both latency and throughput.

# Scenario 3 [ICMP Packet Loss]
First, apply a packet loss of 50% **on the Router** between the Client and Server (either on eth0 or eth2):
```
tc qdisc add dev eth2 root netem loss 50%
```
Again, you may need to delete any previous impairments you applied with:
```
tc qdisc del dev eth2 root netem
```

Packet loss is fairly easy to see in the ping output:
```
root@000af00da7e1:/home/simpleclient# ping 172.18.1.5 -i .1 -c 10

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.158/0.234/0.293/0.057 ms
```
Our latency is fine, but we're dropping about 50% of the packets somewhere in the network. Let's figure out where.
We'll start closest to the source and move up, using 10 Pings from Client to Server as we did above.
First, we capture on our Router eth0 interface:
```
root@6f0df20286b0:/home/router# tcpdump -n -i eth0 icmp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes

You can use the sequence numbers to see that ALL 10 Ehco Reequest packets make it to the Router, but some of the Echo Reply packets are not seen (headed from Server TO Client). For example seq 1, 4, 5 & 9 are dropped somewhere upstream of Router eth0.

Moving one level up, to Router eth1 (interface headed towards server):
```

We see that every request has a corresponding reply. This tells us that some of the requests (eg those with seq 1, 2, 4, 10) are never egressing this interface. Therefore, they are being dropped somewhere between eth0 & eth2; eg the Router.

For reference, the this is the Client output:
```

If we only had access to the Client and Server, we'd see on the Server that all Echo's recieved are being replied to; though some of the Echo's are never reecieved (eg 5, 7 & 9 being dropped between Client & Server):
